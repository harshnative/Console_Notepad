# Console_Notepad
a simple console based notepad for the tech savei peoples 

please download the exe file in the releases section 

the notes are auto saved in the notes.txt which is located in the same directory as of the program itself 
you can place it on the destop and change the icon so that it looks nice:)

this is a simple note taking in the command prompt sytle , it is very lite app in the form of .exe file measuring hardly over 1MB and can run on even the some of low power machines 


press enter continuesly for 50 times to exit the programm or use the close button on the stop 

the font is presseted to 24 which is quit decent and easy on the eyes 

the indentation and the format on the outputted txt file will be same as you type the text in
